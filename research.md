My research focuses on algorithms and applications of **machine learning, deep learning, and healthcare**.

* Machine learning applications: Machine learning and statistical models for electronic health records (EHR) and genomics.
  * Deep learning for biology and medicine: [journal](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2017.0387) 
  * Patient classification from patient records: [journal](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2016.09.014)
  * Patient classification from online text: [conference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5977653/)
  * Unsupervised learning of clinical workflow: [conference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4765602/)

* Machine learning, statistics, scalable and distributed optimization algorithms:
  * **Efficient** and **privacy-preserving** machine learning ([cryptography](/publication#secureMA14), [distributed and scalable learning](/publication#secureRegRression16), [numerical optimization](/publication#privlogit16));
  * [Quantitative genetics](/publication#secureMA14), [Biomedical informatics](/publication#workflowEHR15), Computational biology;


## Academic Services
<a name="academic-services"></a>
I regularly serve as reviewer for top journals and conferences, as well as external/ad-hoc reviewer for some venues (mostly computer science conferences).

* **Genetics/Genomics, Computational biology**: Genome Research, several Nature journals, Scientific Reports, Infection Genetics and Evolution, Journal of Molecular Epidemiology and Evolutionary Genetics of Infectious Diseases (MEEGID), Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC), etc.
* **Statistics, Computer science**: Statistical Methods in Medical Research, ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security (TOPS; formally TISSEC), Neurocomputing, IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI), etc.
* **Biomedical informatics**: JAMIA, AMIA, JMIR, JMIR Medical Informatics, Journal of Methods of Information in Medicine, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, etc.
* **External Reviewer for**: PNAS, IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), IEEE Big Data, etc.
