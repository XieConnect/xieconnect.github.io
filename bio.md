I have a PhD in Computer Science from [Vanderbilt University](http://www.vanderbilt.edu). I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science in 2014 and B.E. in thermal engineering in 2011.

Besides research, I have years of professional experience providing machine learning/NLP consultancies to startups in the bay area, and working as software engineer and tech lead.
